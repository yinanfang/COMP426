    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <div>
      Prof. Mayer-Patel received his Ph.D from the University of
      California, Berkeley in 1999. He subsequently joined the faculty at the
      University of North Carolina where he is currently an Associate
      Professor. His research generally investigates challenges
      associated with streaming of compressed
      media within large-scale distributed systems such as
      tele-immersion.

  <h3>Research</h3>
  <div class="project">
    <div class="title">Recoverable Video Adaptation</div>
    <div class="description"> Existing video adaptation techniques generally lead to
          irreversibly loss of video quality. In this project, we are
          exploring adaptation techniques that can be used to recover high (or
          at least higher) quality video from a set of independently
          constructed lower quality representations.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="project">
    <div class="title">n-Dimensional Display Interface</div>
    <div class="description"> The frame buffer has been the predominant abstraction
      display interfaces since the rise of raster displays. Despite the
      success of the framebuffer, it imposes serious restrictions that
      jeopardize its applicability in the face of new, emerging display
      challenges such as very large displays and mobile low-power
      displays. In this research, we are exploring a new narrow waist
      interface for display resources built around a parallel architecture
      suitable for scalability with respect to both size and power.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <div class="title">Streaming for Visualization</div>
    <div class="description"> We are investigating a general framework for supporting
      remote interactive exploration of large-scale scientific data that
      allows for smoothly negotiated trade-offs between model streaming
      and view streaming and deeply integrated application-level
      knowledge with high- speed transport-level protocol
      mechanisms. The key mechanism in our approach is replicating the
      rendering process at both source and destination as part of
      parallel model/view streaming pipelines that are integrated into
      view prediction.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <div class="title">Streaming for Vision</div>
    <div class="description"> Modern multimedia codecs for video compression built into
      low cost cameras are all highly optimized for the human
      consumer. In other words, lossy techniques introduce error that is
      least perceptible by people. If, however, these codecs need to be
      incorporated into a system that using machine vision, these design
      choices may not be appropriate. We are developing a framework for
      integrating state of the are multimedia encoding and streaming
      techniques with state of the art vision algorithms in order to
      more effectively realize large-scale vision- based video
      processing systems.

  <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <div class="course">
    <div class="title">COMP 116: Introduction to Scientific Programming</div>
    <div class="description"> This course is intended for science majors outside of
      Computer Science and introduces them to basic programming practices
      in the context of scientific data analysis and visualization.
    </div>
    <div class="last">Last taught: Spring 2010</div>
  </div>
  <div class="course">
    <div class="title">COMP 401: Foundations of Programming</div>
    <div class="description"> This course is intended for people who
      already have some experience with programming. Its goal is to
      teach you how to program well in an object-oriented
      style. Object-oriented programming emphasizes a modular design
      that promotes code reuse and structrued solutions for complex
      problems that are easier to change and mantain. Almost all
      modern programming languages rely on some sort of
      object-oriented programming model.

    <div class="title">COMP 416: Introduction to Web Programming</div>
    <div class="description"> This course is intended for non-majors with limited
      programming experience. It introduces to fundamental
      client-side web programming technologies including HTML5,
      CSS, and JavaScript.

    <div class="title">COMP 426: Advanced Web Programming</div>
    <div class="description">This course is intended for majors with intermediate
      programming experience. Students fully develop a modern
      AJAX-based web application and covers both client-side
      and server-side technologies including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript,
      jQuery, PHP, and MySQL.

    <div class="description"> This course is an advanced graduate-level course that covers
      the fundamental concepts in multimedia computing and
      networking. Students are expected to complete an extensive final
      project, some of which have led to publications in refereed
      conferences and workshops.
